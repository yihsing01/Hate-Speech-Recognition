# Hate-Speech-Recognition

# Description
This project implements a hate speech recognition model using transfer learning with RoBERTa.

# Techniques
Transfer learning with RoBERTa<br/>
Synonym augmentation for data imbalance<br/>
Customized activation and loss functions (binary/multiclass)<br/>
L2 regularization to prevent overfitting<br/>
Early stopping to improve training efficiency<br/>
Fine-tuning the RoBERTa model<br/>

# Datasets
This project uses three existing datasets that can be obtained here:

ETHOS: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ethos<br/>
stormfront: https://huggingface.co/datasets/hate_speech18<br/>
